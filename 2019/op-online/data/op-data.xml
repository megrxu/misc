    <rdfs:comment> Monkey D. Garp is an extremely famous and powerful Marine vice admiral. He is the father of Monkey D. Dragon, the paternal grandfather of Monkey D. Luffy, and the adoptive grandfather of Portgas D. Ace. He took charge of both Koby and Helmeppo's training. After the war, he became a Marine Instructor to train new recruits, though still retaining the rank of vice admiral. Notably, Garp was offered the rank of Admiral several times throughout his career, but he refused the offer of promotion every time. Garp is one of the major figures, along with Kong, Sengoku, Shiki, Silvers Rayleigh, and Whitebeard, from the times when the "Pirate King" was still alive.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Wet-Haired Caribou" is an infamous rookie pirate who was at the Sabaody Archipelago around the time of the Straw Hat Pirates' reunion. Deranged, sadistic, and prone to acts of brutal violence, he has earned a bounty of 210,000,000, making him part of the new generation of rookie pirates with bounties over 100,000,000. He is the brother of "Blood Splatterer" Coribou, another infamous rookie, with whom is co-captain of the Caribou Pirates. Both brothers gained their reputations for killing Marines. As both of them have bounties over 70,000,000, they both fulfilled the requirement of the Fake Straw Hat Crew, but they eventually left upon discovering the crew's fraudulence. He is a minor antagonist during the Fish-Man Island Saga, and the central character from Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World Cover Page Serial. Later, he became an ally of Luffy during the Wano Country Arc.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Kaido of the Beasts, also known as the "Strongest Creature in the World", is the Governor-General of the Beasts Pirates and one of the Yonko ruling over the New World. He and his crew currently occupy Wano Country in alliance with its shogun, Kurozumi Orochi, and most recently have entered into another alliance with fellow Yonko Big Mom and her crew, the Big Mom Pirates. Decades ago before the formation of his own crew, Kaido was part of the legendary Rocks Pirates as an apprentice. Kaido was first referred to by Monkey D. Garp in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc and then directly mentioned by Gecko Moria in the Thriller Bark Arc, with his Yonko title revealed just after the Straw Hat Pirates defeated Moria. Thus, Kaido is the third Yonkou mentioned by name and the last one to debut. Due to his actions and role, he is the primary antagonist of the Wano Country Arc and one of the central antagonists of the Yonko Saga.</rdfs:comment>

He is the former commander of the Riku Royal Army (リク王軍, Riku Ō Gun). He is also the father of Rebecca, husband of Scarlett and the son-in-law of Riku Doldo III. He spent ten years as a toy before being freed by the success of his own Operation SOP. After helping bring down the Donquixote Pirates, Kyros currently lives with Rebecca.

    <rdfs:comment> Sabo is the Revolutionary Army's chief of staff, recognized as the "No. 2" of the entire organization, ranking directly under Monkey D. Dragon himself. Next to being the sworn brother of Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace, he is of noble descent, the son of Outlook III and Didit, as well as via his parents the adoptive brother of Sterry, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, whom Sabo has never recognized as such. At a very young age, Sabo ran away from his noble parents in the Goa Kingdom to live alone in the kingdom's Gray Terminal, and he met and befriended Ace not long after. Five years later (12 before the present storyline), the two became friends with Luffy as well, and the three came to consider themselves "brothers", swearing an oath of brotherhood over sake. They also shared the dream to set out to sea as pirates and achieve freedom, Sabo initially planning to do so at age 17. However, after having escaped his parents once more not long after they had caught him and taken him away from his adoptive brothers, Sabo had then already set sail on his own, but his boat was destroyed by a Celestial Dragon moments later. Having been believed to have died during this incident, Sabo had in truth survived due to Dragon saving him, and he thus joined the Revolutionaries. He had lost most of his memories from that point forward but regained them upon learning of Ace's death at Marineford. He currently has a bounty of 602,000,000. He acts as an ally of Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Charlotte Chiffon is the 22nd daughter and the 52nd child of the Charlotte Family and Totto Land's former Minister of Puff (ふんわり大臣, Funwari Daijin, Viz: "Minister of Fluff"). She is Capone Bege's wife and the mother of Capone Pez, as well as a member of Bege's Fire Tank Pirates. Her father is Big Mom's 25th ex-husband, Pound, and her younger twin sister is Lola. Due to her resemblance to Lola, Chiffon was abused by Big Mom in her rage for Lola abandoning an arranged marriage. This led to Chiffon abandoning her ties to her blood family and helping Bege in his attempt to assassinate Big Mom, which caused Big Mom and most of Chiffon's siblings to identify her as an enemy.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Smoker the White Hunter is a Marine officer and the Base Commander of G-5 Marine Base. He was first introduced as a captain in Loguetown, where he made it his mission to capture Luffy, and was later promoted to the rank of commodore, due to the events in Alabasta. At some point during the timeskip, he was promoted to the rank of vice admiral. He is also since his debut the superior of Tashigi, also serving as her mentor. He is a recurring adversary of Luffy. Due to his actions against Luffy at Loguetown, Smoker can be considered as the main antagonist of Loguetown Arc, and acts as a minor antagonist during the Marineford Arc. Despite his rivalry with Luffy, for reasons of encountering common enemies they ended up helping each other during the Alabasta Arc, and forming a temporary alliance during the Punk Hazard Arc, returning after both events to their relationship as enemies.</rdfs:comment>

He and his crew came from West Blue, where Bege was one of the heads of the Five Families of the West. During the timeskip, he became a subordinate of Charlotte Linlin and married Charlotte Chiffon. The two have a son named Capone Pez. While working under the Big Mom Pirates, he held a position of a rook-ranked combatant. Bege formed a temporary alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates in order to kill Big Mom. After his plan failed, Bege effectively became an enemy of the Yonko and her crew. Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty increased from 138,000,000 to 300,000,000. Due to his allegiance and actions, he is the secondary antagonist of the Zou Arc.</rdfs:comment>

    <foaf:name xml:lang="en">Sakazuki</foaf:name>
    <rdfs:comment> Sakazuki, formerly known by his admiral alias Akainu, is the current fleet admiral of the Marines, succeeding the previous fleet admiral, Sengoku. During the first half of the series, he was one of the three admirals, and the last one to be fully revealed. He ascended to the position of fleet admiral after defeating Kuzan in a ten-day duel that left Punk Hazard in its current state. One of his first decisions was to relocate the Marine Headquarters into the New World in preparation for the New Pirate Age. In the manga, he was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji. In the anime, he was mentioned earlier by Vice Admiral Jonathan during the anime-only G-8 Arc, which aired after Akainu had been revealed in the manga. Because of his actions, Akainu was one of the main antagonists of the Marineford Arc and after his promotion, he became one of the central antagonists of the series. Sakazuki is perhaps the most strident follower of Absolute Justice in the entire series, to the point where his extremism prompted an equally high-ranking colleague to resign from the Marines. He believes that a person's heritage is a reflection of how big of a threat they pose - a belief which caused him to target Portgas D. Ace and Monkey D. Luffy during the Battle of Marineford for the purpose of purging their "bad blood", which ultimately led him to personally kill Ace and attempt to kill Luffy, which he failed to do - managing only to leave a massive scar on his chest.</rdfs:comment>

One of the reasons his bounty was higher than Luffy's when they arrived at the Archipelago was a result of him and his crew causing huge numbers of civilian casualties in the course of their activities. Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty was raised from 315,000,000 to 470,000,000.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Portgas D. Ace, born as Gol D. Ace and nicknamed "Fire Fist" Ace, was the adopted older brother of Luffy and Sabo, and son of the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger and his lover, Portgas D. Rouge. He was adopted by Monkey D. Garp as wished by Roger to him before his birth. Ace was the 2nd division commander of the Whitebeard Pirates and one-time captain of the Spade Pirates. He also is the central character from Ace's Great Blackbeard Search Cover Page Serial. Hunted by the World Government for his lineage, Ace was captured and sentenced to death, which resulted in the Battle of Marineford in an all out clash of powers. Ace was freed, but he sacrificed his life to protect his younger brother from Akainu. His death ultimately proved to be the catalyst leading to Luffy training for two years to become strong enough to protect his friends, paving the way for the second half of the series.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates. A cyborg from Water 7, he was originally the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers. He is originally from South Blue , but left 32 years ago as a four-year-old child. He was originally named "Cutty Flam" until he threw away his original name for his nickname per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. At the request of the Franky Family, Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny. He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join Luffy's crew. He currently has a bounty of 94,000,000. Previously going by the epithet, "Cyborg" Franky, he has since gained the new nickname, "Iron Man".</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top three fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. By the time Luffy and his crew left the East Blue for the Grand Line, they had defeated all the strongest pirate crews of the eastern seas, with Luffy himself defeating all their captains. This earned him the highest bounty of the East Blue at 30,000,000. He has since gained a worldwide reputation for causing trouble, challenging the Shichibukai, the Marines, and the Yonko, additionally committing felonies and actions which were deemed threatening by the World Government. Furthermore, in the majority of these confrontations, he has emerged as the victor. He has gained a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane", after causing an incident in Enies Lobby, assaulting a World Noble at Sabaody Archipelago, entering and escaping from Impel Down (while indirectly causing a large-scale riot in the process), and joining the Battle of Marineford. He is, therefore, infamous for being the only known pirate to not only deliberately attack the three most important government facilities, but also escape from all of them alive after facing incredibly powerful opponents in each one. The additional fact that he punched a World Noble with full knowledge of the consequences, as well as his heritage, has caused Luffy to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki and Marine Headquarters. At the beginning of the Levely Arc, Luffy's achievements were compiled, greatly inflating his infamy, which was already immense to begin with. This includes his relationship as a sworn brother to both the late commander of the second division of the Whitebeard Pirates and the son of Gol D. Roger, Portgas D. Ace, and the Revolutionary Army Chief-of-staff, Sabo; the fleet that unofficially formed under him; the infiltration operation of Big Mom's territory, Totto Land, where he defeated the Sweet Commanders Charlotte Cracker and Charlotte Katakuri, attempted an assassination on Charlotte Linlin herself, while destroying her castle (unintentionally), and created a prompt alliance with Germa 66, the Sun Pirates, and the Fire Tank Pirates before escaping after the assassination failed. Though his capabilities were slightly exaggerated by the press, his achievements were great enough for him to be officially titled the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea". These acts, among other things, have given him his current bounty of 1,500,000,000. Having had a bounty of 300,000,000 prior to his arrival at the Sabaody Archipelago, Luffy is one of eleven rookie pirates who simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties over 100,000,000, a group which would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation".</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Gol D. Roger, more commonly known as Gold Roger, was a legendary pirate who, as the captain of the Roger Pirates, held the title of Pirate King and owned the legendary treasure known as "One Piece". He was also the lover of Portgas D. Rouge and biological father of Portgas D. Ace. Roger was famed as the man who did what no one thought possible – he conquered the Grand Line and amassed a vast fortune. Afterwards, knowing that he would soon die from an incurable disease, Roger disbanded his crew before turning himself in to be executed. The World Government intended to have Roger be publicly executed to discourage piracy, but his last words had the opposite impact. He stated that anyone who can find his treasure can claim it. As such, this made Roger single-handedly responsible for starting the Golden Age of Pirates.</rdfs:comment>

  <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://one-piece.local/#character/Issho">
    <rdfs:comment> Issho, commonly known by his alias Fujitora, is a Marine admiral. He was conscripted into the Marines through a World Military Draft during the two-year timeskip along with fellow newcomer Ryokugyu, both filling the two vacancies in the admiral positions caused by Kuzan's resignation and Sakazuki's promotion. Fujitora was first mentioned by Sakazuki when the latter was first discussing plans to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law. His following mission and actions on Dressrosa made him the first admiral to make an appearance after the timeskip and the secondary antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc. Much like his predecessor, Kuzan, Fujitora is strongly against the Marines' dogma of "Absolute Justice" and extremely vocal in his opposition of it. His disgust with the corruption and evil in the world is such that he intentionally blinded himself many years ago so as to avoid ever seeing it again. He particularly holds strong disdain for the Shichibukai system, longing to disestablish it, and after learning about the horrific atrocities committed by Donquixote Doflamingo of the Shichibukai in Dressrosa, Fujitora formally apologized to King Riku and his citizens on behalf of the Marines in front of the world, thus infuriating Sakazuki and risking his admiral position.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Caesar Clown, who was referred to as "Master" by his subordinates, is a scientist, a former colleague of Vegapunk, the primary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc, and the first main antagonist the Straw Hats face in the New World. He is the leading expert on chemical weapons of mass destruction and has a bounty of 300,000,000 on his head. During the Dressrosa Arc, Donquixote Doflamingo declared Caesar to be his direct subordinate, and thus protected from the law. Upon Doflamingo's defeat and arrest, this protection was lost, and Caesar's criminal status was once again operational in full. After a period as a hostage of the Straw Hat-Heart Pirate Alliance, he fell into the custody of Big Mom after Capone Bege retrieved and escorted both him and Sanji to Whole Cake Island. He was later liberated by the Fire Tank Pirates and took part in the assassination attempt against Big Mom. Following the plan's failure and disbandment of the alliance, he was finally given back his heart and parted ways with his former captors.</rdfs:comment>

Subsequently, he became a reporter for the World Economic Journal, under "Big News" Morgans. Like Minatomo, Attach began as an SBS joke Eiichiro Oda used to "explain" a triviality - specifically, how the Marines always had such high-quality illustrations of the world's most dangerous and/or unreachable criminals.

He is the first son of the late Donquixote Homing and the older brother of the late Rosinante, both of whom he killed out of feeling betrayed by them. Doflamingo became the king of Dressrosa after taking the throne from Riku Doldo III eight years before the start of the series. He ruled the country tyrannically until he was stripped of his positions as a Shichibukai and king after he was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy near the end of the Dressrosa Arc, being arrested alongside most of his crew members by Admiral Fujitora and locked up at Impel Down Level 6. He is a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Battle of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Shichibukai, and the primary antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and the Dressrosa Saga as a whole, being the impetus for the entirety of the saga's events.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "God" Usopp is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. He was born in Syrup Village and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. Despite his normal cowardice, Usopp dreams of becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every day in pursuit of living up to this dream. Before join to the crew, he acts as the main ally of the Straw Hat Pirates during the Syrup Village Arc, joining at the end of the same arc, being officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join. He left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, being after Nami, Chopper and Robin, the fourth to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc. His original bounty of 30,000,000 was credited to his alias and alter-ego "Sogeking". During the events in Dressrosa, Usopp awakened his Kenbunshoku Haki, making him the fourth member of the Straw Hat crew to demonstrate and use a form of Haki. His current bounty, 200,000,000, is a huge jump from his original, due to his role as "God" for saving all the toy slaves in Doflamingo's underground trades. This took him from the third lowest bounty of the crew to the fifth highest, jumping past the previous holder, Nico Robin, who has since dropped to fifth place after the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, serving as a helmsman in his current capacity with them. As of now, he is officially the tenth member of the Straw Hat crew and the ninth to join. He is a whale shark fish-man who served as the second captain of the Sun Pirates after Fisher Tiger, and a former Shichibukai from 11 years ago until the Battle of Marineford two years ago. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-man and continues to live his life in the hopes of seeing that dream's completion. His name was first mentioned by Yosaku, when he was explaining about the Shichibukai. However, he is formally introduced much later, during the Impel Down Arc. He renounced his Shichibukai title at the Battle of Marineford, allying himself with the Whitebeard Pirates. After Whitebeard's death, his crew formed an alliance with Big Mom to protect Fish-Man Island. He befriended Monkey D. Luffy during the Battle of Marineford, and later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Neptune Royal Family and the Ryugu Kingdom. Luffy invited him to join the Straw Hats, but Jinbe held it off until he had severed ties with Big Mom. He would later do so during the Whole Cake Island Arc and officially become a Straw Hat member. Jinbe's first bounty was 76,000,000. Eventually, his bounty raised to 250,000,000. After he resigned from the Shichibukai, his bounty increased to 438,000,000. He also is the central character from Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea Cover Page Serial.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment> Marshall D. Teach, most commonly referred to by his epithet "Blackbeard", is the admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of the Yonko. He is also the only known person in history to wield the power of two Devil Fruits. He started out his pirate career as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates' 2nd division, until he murdered Thatch, the 4th division commander, for the Yami Yami no Mi and defected. Prior to the two-year timeskip, he briefly held the position of Shichibukai after defeating and handing Ace over to the Marines, before resigning upon returning from Impel Down with Level Six prisoners to strengthen his crew. His actions resulted in him being considered a part of the Worst Generation along with the Eleven Supernovas, and he received the title of Yonko after slaying Whitebeard during the Battle of Marineford and defeating the Whitebeard Pirates during the timeskip. Due to his actions, he can be considered the tertiary antagonist of the Impel Down Arc, and one of the main antagonists of the Marineford Arc, the Summit War Saga, and the remainder of the One Piece manga and anime overall.</rdfs:comment>

He was the first member to join the crew, and is considered one of the most dangerous members in it after Luffy. His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew before he obtained his first bounty. His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation". He currently has a bounty of 320,000,000, which is the 4th highest in the crew, after Luffy, Jinbe, and Sanji.</rdfs:comment>
