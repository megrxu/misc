"Red Flag" X Drake (read as "Diez Drake"), is the Captain of the Marine Secret Special Unit SWORD, and the captain of the Drake Pirates, who defected from his position as rear admiral to go undercover as a pirate.
He is one of twelve pirates referred to as the "Worst Generation", and prior to the two-year timeskip had a bounty of 222,000,000.
Currently, he and his crew are affiliated with the Beasts Pirates, a major pirate crew led by Kaido, one of the Yonko.
X Drake serves as one of the crew's Headliners and one of the Flying Six, six of the strongest Headliners.
Drake is the son of the Marine-turned-pirate Diez Barrels, and as a young adult was called Dory (ドリィ, Dorii).
He was physically abused by his father, and when the Donquixote Pirates invaded Barrels' hideout 13 years ago, he abandoned Barrels' crew as they were trapped and massacred.
