Avalo Pizarro, also known as the "Corrupt King", was one of the criminals who was given a life sentence in Level 6 of Impel Down, as his crimes were so atrocious he had to effectively be erased from history.
Prior to his life of crime, he was once a king of a North Blue kingdom that overthrew him for his despotic ways.
He has since been freed by Marshall D. Teach and has become a member of the Blackbeard Pirates.
He is currently one of the Ten Titanic Captains, and the captain of the Fourth Ship of the Blackbeard Pirates.
