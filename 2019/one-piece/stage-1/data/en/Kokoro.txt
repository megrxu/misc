Kokoro, an icefish mermaid, is the main conductor of the Sea Train, Puffing Tom, at the station just outside of Water 7.
She has a granddaughter named Chimney, who accompanies her everywhere.
She was Tom's secretary during the days of Tom's Workers.
Kokoro poses as a human, hiding her mermaid physique because her tail fin forked in two around the age of thirty and allowed her to walk on land.
