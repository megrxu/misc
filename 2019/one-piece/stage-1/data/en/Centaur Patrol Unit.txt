The Centaur Patrol Unit was a unit of centaurs (humans who had their crippled legs replaced with functional animal ones by Trafalgar Law's powers) led by an alligator centaur named Brownbeard.
They were under the ultimate control of Caesar Clown, who had them patrol Punk Hazard for trespassers.
Brownbeard rebelled against Caesar for deceiving him while many others were left outside to die by the H2S experiment.
