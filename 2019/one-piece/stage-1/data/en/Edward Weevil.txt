Edward Weevil, or "Whitebeard Jr.", is the self-proclaimed son of "Whitebeard" Edward Newgate and was one of the Shichibukai, until the organization's dissolution.
His mother is Miss Bakkin, the self-proclaimed lover of Newgate.
He was first mentioned by Commodore Brannew in a discussion of the current Shichibukai ranks to several high-ranking Marine officers, but was not explicitly named until after Donquixote Doflamingo's defeat.
