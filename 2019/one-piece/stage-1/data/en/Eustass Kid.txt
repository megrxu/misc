Eustass "Captain" Kid is a notorious pirate from South Blue and the captain of the Kid Pirates.
He is one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".
One of the reasons his bounty was higher than Luffy's when they arrived at the Archipelago was a result of him and his crew causing huge numbers of civilian casualties in the course of their activities.
Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty was raised from 315,000,000 to 470,000,000.
