Mizuta Mawaritosuki was the younger of the two Mizuta Twins, identical twin brothers of the Rumbar Pirates.
He and his brother, Madaisuki, were identified by Oda in a SBS question.
A fan asked why one of the Rumbar Pirates that died singing had a sword in his skull.
Oda explained that this was because they were two identical pirates who died two separate ways.
