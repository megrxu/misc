Sengoku the Buddha was the fleet admiral of the Marines before the timeskip, succeeding Kong and preceding Sakazuki.
He was also one of the major figures along with Whitebeard, Shiki, and Monkey D. Garp during the times when Gol D. Roger was still alive, and still continues to be in the present, even after his retirement from the Marines.
Sometime during the timeskip, he became an Inspector General.
He raised Donquixote Rosinante like his own son.
Due to his actions and his position in the Marines, he is one of the main antagonists of the Marineford Arc.
