Charlotte Chiffon is the 22nd daughter and the 52nd child of the Charlotte Family and Totto Land's former Minister of Puff (ふんわり大臣, Funwari Daijin, Viz: "Minister of Fluff").
She is Capone Bege's wife and the mother of Capone Pez, as well as a member of Bege's Fire Tank Pirates.
Her father is Big Mom's 25th ex-husband, Pound, and her younger twin sister is Lola.
Due to her resemblance to Lola, Chiffon was abused by Big Mom in her rage for Lola abandoning an arranged marriage.
This led to Chiffon abandoning her ties to her blood family and helping Bege in his attempt to assassinate Big Mom, which caused Big Mom and most of Chiffon's siblings to identify her as an enemy.
