The Five Elders are the highest-ranking Celestial Dragons and the heads of the World Government.
They essentially rule the entire world, with the only individual of higher authority they answer to being the mysterious Im who sits on the Empty Throne.
They are the men who command the Marines and Cipher Pol, and the ones who once made a pact with the Shichibukai before they're abolished, making them one of the main antagonist groups of the series.
So far, none of their names have been revealed and it is unknown how they became the leaders of the World Government or how long they have been ruling it.
