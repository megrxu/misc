Kozuki Hiyori is the daughter of Kozuki Oden and Kozuki Toki.
She is originally Kozuki Momonosuke's younger sister, but when he was sent into the future, she has become older than him.
To the people of Wano, Hiyori became known as Komurasaki, working as an oiran of the dayu (太夫, dayū) rank, the highest of all.
However, she lost this status after angering the current shogun Kurozumi Orochi and being presumed to have been murdered by Kyoshiro.
