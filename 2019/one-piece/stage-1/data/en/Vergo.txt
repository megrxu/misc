"Demon Bamboo" Vergo was one of the four elite officers and the first to occupy the Heart seat of the Donquixote Pirates under the codename Corazon.
He was a Marine vice admiral, and head of G-5, who made his debut at Punk Hazard.
Due to his duplicitous conduct and allegiances, he can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc.
