Three-Headed Baskerville are the Chief Justices on the island of Enies Lobby in the service of the World Government.
While Baskerville appeared to be a three headed person, he is actually three people who like dressing up like one person.
The one on the left is Bas, the one in the middle is And, and the one on the right is Kerville.
