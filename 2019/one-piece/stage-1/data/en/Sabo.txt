Sabo is the Revolutionary Army's chief of staff, recognized as the "No.
2" of the entire organization, ranking directly under Monkey D. Dragon himself.
Next to being the sworn brother of Monkey D. Luffy and Portgas D. Ace, he is of noble descent, the son of Outlook III and Didit, as well as via his parents the adoptive brother of Sterry, the current king of the Goa Kingdom, whom Sabo has never recognized as such.
At a very young age, Sabo ran away from his noble parents in the Goa Kingdom to live alone in the kingdom's Gray Terminal, and he met and befriended Ace not long after.
Five years later (12 before the present storyline), the two became friends with Luffy as well, and the three came to consider themselves "brothers", swearing an oath of brotherhood over sake.
They also shared the dream to set out to sea as pirates and achieve freedom, Sabo initially planning to do so at age 17.
However, after having escaped his parents once more not long after they had caught him and taken him away from his adoptive brothers, Sabo had then already set sail on his own, but his boat was destroyed by a Celestial Dragon moments later.
Having been believed to have died during this incident, Sabo had in truth survived due to Dragon saving him, and he thus joined the Revolutionaries.
He had lost most of his memories from that point forward but regained them upon learning of Ace's death at Marineford.
He currently has a bounty of 602,000,000.
He acts as an ally of Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc.
