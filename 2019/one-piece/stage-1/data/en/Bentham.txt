Bentham of the Wild, alias Mr. 2 Bon Kurei, is a former officer agent of Baroque Works and an okama.
He was a major antagonist during the Alabasta Arc, and one of the central characters from Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque Works", along with the rest of Baroque Works Officer Agents.
While he was once an enemy of Luffy's as a member of Baroque Works, the two became quick friends, leading Bon Kurei to sacrifice himself for Luffy both at Alabasta and later at Impel Down, being one of his main allies during that Story Arc.
He is currently the new queen of Newkama Land.
