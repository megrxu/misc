"Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates.
He is a skeleton that the Straw Hats found on board of a ghost ship after drifting into the Florian Triangle for 50 years.
He is a Devil Fruit user who ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, and is undead, having been brought back into a pseudo-immortal state because of its powers.
His dream is to, after sailing around the world, reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
He is the ninth member of the Straw Hat crew, and the eighth to join Luffy's crew, as well as being the oldest member of the crew and the second tallest member on board after Jinbe.
He is also one of the two swordsmen onboard their current ship, with the other being Roronoa Zoro.
He fills the role of the long-awaited musician that Luffy had wanted for his crew ever since his journey began.
He currently has a bounty of 83,000,000.
