Pekoms is a combatant of the Big Mom Pirates and a lion mink.
He is partnered with Tamago, and both are responsible for collecting the monthly payment of sweets from Fish-Man Island in exchange for Big Mom's protection.
Pekoms originally sailed the seas under Pedro as a member of the Nox Pirates before he and some of the crew joined the Big Mom Pirates.
During the Whole Cake Island Arc, he betrayed the crew in an attempt to help Monkey D. Luffy escape Totto Land and honor Pedro's self-sacrifice.
