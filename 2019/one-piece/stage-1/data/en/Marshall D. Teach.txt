Marshall D. Teach, most commonly referred to by his epithet "Blackbeard", is the admiral of the Blackbeard Pirates and one of the Yonko.
He is also the only known person in history to wield the power of two Devil Fruits.
He started out his pirate career as a member of the Whitebeard Pirates' 2nd division, until he murdered Thatch, the 4th division commander, for the Yami Yami no Mi and defected.
Prior to the two-year timeskip, he briefly held the position of Shichibukai after defeating and handing Ace over to the Marines, before resigning upon returning from Impel Down with Level Six prisoners to strengthen his crew.
His actions resulted in him being considered a part of the Worst Generation along with the Eleven Supernovas, and he received the title of Yonko after slaying Whitebeard during the Battle of Marineford and defeating the Whitebeard Pirates during the timeskip.
Due to his actions, he can be considered the tertiary antagonist of the Impel Down Arc, and one of the main antagonists of the Marineford Arc, the Summit War Saga, and the remainder of the One Piece manga and anime overall.
