Kawamatsu the Kappa is a yokozuna-ranked sumo wrestler.
He is a fish-man who was shipwrecked in Wano and orphaned soon afterwards.
After Kozuki Oden rescued him from citizens ostracizing him, he went on to serve as one of Oden's Nine Red Scabbards until Oden's death 20 years ago.
Kawamatsu would go on to be imprisoned by the Beasts Pirates for 13 years until he was ultimately freed by Monkey D. Luffy, and he reunited with the Nine Red Scabbards to fight Kurozumi Orochi and Kaido and avenge Oden.
