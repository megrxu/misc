Capone "Gang" Bege is a mafia don-turned-pirate and the captain of the Fire Tank Pirates.
He is also one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".
He and his crew came from West Blue, where Bege was one of the heads of the Five Families of the West.
During the timeskip, he became a subordinate of Charlotte Linlin and married Charlotte Chiffon.
The two have a son named Capone Pez.
While working under the Big Mom Pirates, he held a position of a rook-ranked combatant.
Bege formed a temporary alliance with the Straw Hat Pirates in order to kill Big Mom.
After his plan failed, Bege effectively became an enemy of the Yonko and her crew.
Sometime during the timeskip, his bounty increased from 138,000,000 to 300,000,000.
Due to his allegiance and actions, he is the secondary antagonist of the Zou Arc.
