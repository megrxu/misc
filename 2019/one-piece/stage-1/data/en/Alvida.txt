"Iron Mace" Alvida is the former captain of the Alvida Pirates and the first antagonist encountered by Luffy in the anime present timeline (in the manga, Higuma was the first villain).
Due to her actions, she can be regarded as the secondary antagonist of the Romance Dawn Arc and the tertiary antagonist of the Loguetown Arc.
After her defeat against Luffy, she allies with Buggy and becomes one of the two captains of the Buggy and Alvida Alliance.
She was the acting captain of the crew during Buggy's time in Impel Down and during the Battle of Marineford.
After reuniting with Buggy, his army of Impel Down Convicts, and Galdino (and with the addition of Buggy becoming a Shichibukai), her alliance with him has evolved into the Underworld Organization known as Buggy's Delivery.
