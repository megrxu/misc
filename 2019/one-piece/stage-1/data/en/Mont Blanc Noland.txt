Mont Blanc Noland was an admiral (提督, Teitoku) in the Lvneel Kingdom who made multiple trips into the Grand Line.
He discovered a city of gold on Jaya, but found upon returning there with Lvneel's king that it had disappeared, causing him to be executed.
He was then memorialized in a fairy tale as a liar and trickster.
