Minatomo-san is a carpenter who was created by Oda as a One Piece SBS joke character to explain how the door Higuma kicked off its hinges was suddenly back in place as the bandit left the bar, after Higuma smashed a bottle of sake over Shanks.
According to Oda, Minatomo is a carpenter who cannot go past a broken door without repairing it.
Since the answer was given, Minatomo has made several appearances in the anime, normally seen either randomly standing next to people or repairing doors.
Minatomo's appearances are similar in idea to Pandaman and Sam.
He is a descendant of someone who originated from Wano Country who left Wano for the East Blue a few decades ago.
He is related to another carpenter who is also only known as Minatomo.
