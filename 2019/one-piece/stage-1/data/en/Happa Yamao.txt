Happa Yamao is a civilian of Water 7 whom Usopp bought wood and supplies from in order to repair the Going Merry.
Happa also gave Usopp some rice balls.
He is an old bandit turned carpenter who moved to Water 7 from the "Gourmet City", Pucci.
He was initially identified by Oda as "Happa", then given the name "Yamao" in Blue Deep.
When questioned about the inconsistency, Oda simply responded that the man's name is Happa Yamao.
