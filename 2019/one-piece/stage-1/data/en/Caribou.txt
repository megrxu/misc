"Wet-Haired Caribou" is an infamous rookie pirate who was at the Sabaody Archipelago around the time of the Straw Hat Pirates' reunion.
Deranged, sadistic, and prone to acts of brutal violence, he has earned a bounty of 210,000,000, making him part of the new generation of rookie pirates with bounties over 100,000,000.
He is the brother of "Blood Splatterer" Coribou, another infamous rookie, with whom is co-captain of the Caribou Pirates.
Both brothers gained their reputations for killing Marines.
As both of them have bounties over 70,000,000, they both fulfilled the requirement of the Fake Straw Hat Crew, but they eventually left upon discovering the crew's fraudulence.
He is a minor antagonist during the Fish-Man Island Saga, and the central character from Caribou's Kehihihihi in the New World Cover Page Serial.
Later, he became an ally of Luffy during the Wano Country Arc.
