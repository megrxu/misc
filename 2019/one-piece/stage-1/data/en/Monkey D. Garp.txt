Monkey D. Garp is an extremely famous and powerful Marine vice admiral.
He is the father of Monkey D. Dragon, the paternal grandfather of Monkey D. Luffy, and the adoptive grandfather of Portgas D. Ace.
He took charge of both Koby and Helmeppo's training.
After the war, he became a Marine Instructor to train new recruits, though still retaining the rank of vice admiral.
Notably, Garp was offered the rank of Admiral several times throughout his career, but he refused the offer of promotion every time.
Garp is one of the major figures, along with Kong, Sengoku, Shiki, Silvers Rayleigh, and Whitebeard, from the times when the "Pirate King" was still alive.
