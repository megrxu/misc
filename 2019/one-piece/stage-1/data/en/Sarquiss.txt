"Big Knife" Sarquiss is the former first mate of the Bellamy Pirates, with a bounty of 38,000,000 on his head.
His epithet originates from the large dagger he always wields, which bears a strong resemblance to a massive kukri.
Due to his actions, he can be considered a supporting antagonist of the Jaya Arc.
