The Risky Brothers are two male pirates working as members of the Rolling Pirates under their captain, Lola.
They were members of the Thriller Bark Victim's Association, a group of Gecko Moria's victims who banded together.
During the time their shadows were stolen from them, they were placed in two squirrel zombies who were also named the Risky Brothers.
