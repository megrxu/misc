Kozuki Momonosuke is an inhabitant of Wano Country and the son of the late daimyo of the Kuri region and patriarch of the Kozuki Family, Kozuki Oden.
He was born 28 years before the present day, but traveled 20 years forward in time when he was 8 years old.
He was first mentioned when Kin'emon told Sanji that he came to Punk Hazard to rescue his "son".
His given name was revealed when the samurai was asking if the captive children in the Biscuits Room had seen him, and his clan name was revealed when Kin'emon spoke of his true heritage.
