Shiryu of the Rain was the Head Jailer of Impel Down until he himself was imprisoned on Level 6 death row for his excessive, murderous violence against prisoners.
When temporarily released to help Magellan quell the prison riot caused by Monkey D. Luffy and Marshall D. Teach coming to Impel Down, he chose to go against what he was ordered and instead assist the Blackbeard Pirates, ultimately deciding to join them.
Currently, he is one of the Ten Titanic Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates as captain of the Second Ship.
