Camie is a kissing gourami mermaid that first appeared in Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll cover story.
She first appeared in the main series after being spat out of a large sea boar that was saved by Hatchan, along with her starfish pet and master, Pappag.
While dreaming of becoming a designer, she worked on Hatchan's Takoyaki 8 when she first met the Straw Hat Pirates.
After the timeskip, she is a waitress at the Mermaid Cafe on Fish-Man Island.
