Donquixote Doflamingo, nicknamed "Heavenly Yaksha", was the captain of the Donquixote Pirates, a former Shichibukai with a frozen bounty of 340,000,000, the most influential underworld broker under the codename "Joker", and is a former World Noble of the Donquixote Family descent.
He is the first son of the late Donquixote Homing and the older brother of the late Rosinante, both of whom he killed out of feeling betrayed by them.
Doflamingo became the king of Dressrosa after taking the throne from Riku Doldo III eight years before the start of the series.
He ruled the country tyrannically until he was stripped of his positions as a Shichibukai and king after he was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy near the end of the Dressrosa Arc, being arrested alongside most of his crew members by Admiral Fujitora and locked up at Impel Down Level 6.
He is a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Battle of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Shichibukai, and the primary antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc and the Dressrosa Saga as a whole, being the impetus for the entirety of the saga's events.
