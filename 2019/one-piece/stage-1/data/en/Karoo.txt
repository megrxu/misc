Karoo is Vivi's pet super spot-billed duck, a fast-footed riding bird (one of the fastest modes of transportation available in Alabasta).
Alongside his owner Vivi, Karoo infiltrated the organization known as Baroque Works.
With her, he ended up traveling with the Straw Hat Pirates for most of the Alabasta Saga after their cover was blown.
He is the leader of the Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops in Alabasta.
