The Pacifista are human weapons (人間兵器, ningen-heiki) developed by Marine head scientist, Dr. Vegapunk.
They are cyborgs built in the mold of the Shichibukai Bartholomew Kuma, who was the cyborg prototype for the project.
As stated by Sentomaru, the funds required for the construction of just one Pacifista are roughly equal to that of a Marine-issued battleship.
Sentomaru noted that after the timeskip period, PX-5 and PX-7 were outdated models from two years ago, meaning that the Pacifista project has been updated and modified.
