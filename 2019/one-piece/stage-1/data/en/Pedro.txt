Pedro of the Treetops was a jaguar mink and captain of the Guardians.
He was the former captain of the Nox Pirates who sailed in search of a Poneglyph, and he earned a bounty of 382,000,000 in the process, but his journey was cut short in Totto Land.
He returned to Totto Land to accompany the Sanji Retrieval Team in their quest to rescue Sanji.
During the escape from Whole Cake Island, Pedro sacrificed himself to ensure his team's escape, as he believed the Straw Hats will bring about the Dawn of the World.
