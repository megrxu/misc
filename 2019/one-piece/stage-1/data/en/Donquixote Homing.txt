Saint Donquixote Homing is the deceased father of Doflamingo and Rosinante.
A former World Noble of the Donquixote Family, he withdrew from his position and left Mary Geoise in order to live a normal life with his family.
After suffering two years of abuse from prejudiced civilians, Homing was killed by his then ten-year old son, Doflamingo.
