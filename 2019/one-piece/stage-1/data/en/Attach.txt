Attach, commonly nicknamed Attachan, is a prolific photographer who once headed the Marines' Photography Department.
Though he supplied photographs of many prominent outlaws - including most of the Straw Hat Pirates - for the Marines' wanted posters, his frequent blunders led to his dismissal some time after the Battle of Marineford.
Subsequently, he became a reporter for the World Economic Journal, under "Big News" Morgans.
Like Minatomo, Attach began as an SBS joke Eiichiro Oda used to "explain" a triviality - specifically, how the Marines always had such high-quality illustrations of the world's most dangerous and/or unreachable criminals.
In time, however, he became a fully canon character, with minor but tangible impact on the story.
