Shimotsuki Yasuie, also known as "Yasu the Hedgehog", Tonoyasu, or just Yasu (ヤス, Yasu), was a member of the Shimotsuki Family, and a taikomochi who lived in Ebisu Town near the capital of Wano Country.
He was the father of Toko.
Back when the Kozuki Family ruled over Wano Country, Yasuie served as the daimyo of Hakumai.
Twenty years after Kurozumi Orochi's takeover of Wano, Yasuie sacrificed himself in an effort to mislead the shogun's forces and enable Kozuki Momonosuke's revolution to continue.
