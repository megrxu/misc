Grandpa Ryu was the name of the Sennenryu that traveled with the Straw Hat Pirates (along with Apis) during the Warship Island Arc.
Ryu was a very old and weakened dragon; so much so that he could no longer fly.
He was sometimes somewhat senile and tried to eat both Luffy and Usopp thinking they were food.
For some strange reason, Luffy was able to understand what Ryu was saying and relayed his last message to Apis.
