"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, serving as a helmsman in his current capacity with them.
As of now, he is officially the tenth member of the Straw Hat crew and the ninth to join.
He is a whale shark fish-man who served as the second captain of the Sun Pirates after Fisher Tiger, and a former Shichibukai from 11 years ago until the Battle of Marineford two years ago.
His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-man and continues to live his life in the hopes of seeing that dream's completion.
His name was first mentioned by Yosaku, when he was explaining about the Shichibukai.
However, he is formally introduced much later, during the Impel Down Arc.
He renounced his Shichibukai title at the Battle of Marineford, allying himself with the Whitebeard Pirates.
After Whitebeard's death, his crew formed an alliance with Big Mom to protect Fish-Man Island.
He befriended Monkey D. Luffy during the Battle of Marineford, and later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'Ã©tat against the Neptune Royal Family and the Ryugu Kingdom.
Luffy invited him to join the Straw Hats, but Jinbe held it off until he had severed ties with Big Mom.
He would later do so during the Whole Cake Island Arc and officially become a Straw Hat member.
Jinbe's first bounty was 76,000,000.
Eventually, his bounty raised to 250,000,000.
After he resigned from the Shichibukai, his bounty increased to 438,000,000.
He also is the central character from Solo Journey of Jinbe, Knight of the Sea Cover Page Serial.
