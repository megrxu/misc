Donquixote Rosinante was formerly a World Noble of the Donquixote Family descent, as the second son of Donquixote Homing and the younger brother of Donquixote Doflamingo.
After his family lost their status as Celestial Dragons and became pariahs, Rosinante became an Elite Officer of the Donquixote Pirates, serving under Doflamingo under the codename Corazon.
The truth, however, was that he was a Marine Commander, working undercover in order to stop Doflamingo.
He was found out by the former Corazon, Vergo, and was executed by Doflamingo 13 years ago.
