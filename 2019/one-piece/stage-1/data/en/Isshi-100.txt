The Isshi-20 were the twenty most skilled doctors on Drum Island, whom Wapol took for himself in order to make his subjects dependent on him for their services.
The Isshi-100 are the Isshi-20 renamed two years after their introduction, as they have recruited eighty additional doctors, becoming a group of one hundred doctors.
They are now led by Kureha.
