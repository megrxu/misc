Bartholomew Kuma is a former Shichibukai, the former king of the Sorbet Kingdom, and a former officer of the Revolutionary Army with a bounty of 296,000,000.
Once feared as an extremely vicious pirate, earning himself the title "Tyrant", he is now a human weapon called "Pacifista", developed by Vegapunk.
Once Vegapunk finished his modifications on Kuma, the Shichibukai was converted into the first complete Pacifista cyborg, with the serial PX-0, and figuratively died in the process.
Currently, he is a slave-to-rent for the World Nobles.
He is also a major antagonist in the Marineford Arc where he took part in the Battle of Marineford and sided with the Marines, along with most of the other Shichibukai.
