Chadros Higelyges, better known as Brownbeard, is a former New World pirate.
After Whitebeard's death he went off and took control of Foodvalten, one of the New World islands formerly under Whitebeard's protection.
After his defeat at the hands of Basil Hawkins, he quit being a pirate and resided on Punk Hazard, where he became the boss of the Centaur Patrol Unit which guarded part of the island, until his "Master" Caesar Clown betrayed him.
