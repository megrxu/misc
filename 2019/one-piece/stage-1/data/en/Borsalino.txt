Borsalino, more commonly known by his alias Kizaru, is an admiral in the Marines.
After Aokiji resigned from the Marines and Akainu was promoted to fleet admiral, Kizaru is now the only remaining admiral from the previous trio.
He was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the Straw Hat's initial encounter with Aokiji.
Because of his actions, Kizaru can be considered the secondary antagonist of the Sabaody Archipelago Arc and one of the major antagonists of the Marineford Arc.
