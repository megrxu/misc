Kaku is first seen as one of the five foremen of Galley-La Company's Dock One and specializes in mechanics, diagnostics, and housecalls.
It was Kaku who inspected the Going Merry and informed the Straw Hat Pirates that it was broken beyond repair.
Later on, it was revealed that Kaku was a member of CP9, operating undercover in order to obtain the Pluton blueprints from Iceburg.
Along with his colleagues, he has been dismissed from CP9 by Spandam.
For unexplained reasons, he was later reinstated and promoted to CP-0.
He was one of the major antagonists during the Water 7 and Enies Lobby Arcs.
