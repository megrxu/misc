"Desert King" Sir Crocodile is the former president of the mysterious crime syndicate Baroque Works, the primary antagonist of the Alabasta Arc, and the central antagonist of the Alabasta Saga.
He is one of the longest running and most noteworthy primary adversaries of the series, as he was the first enemy to hand Luffy a complete and utter defeat, as well as one of only two who has defeated Luffy more than once.
He was originally introduced as a Shichibukai but was later stripped of his title after attempting to take control of the desert kingdom Alabasta.
Thanks to Luffy, he managed to escape from Impel Down and went to Marineford to participate in the war.
After the war, he and his subordinate Daz Bonez decided to head out to the New World.
