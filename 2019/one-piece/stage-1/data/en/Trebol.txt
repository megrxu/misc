Trebol is one of the top three officers of the Donquixote Pirates.
He occupies the Club seat of the Donquixote Family, and is the leader of the crew's Trebol Army subdivision.
He is also personally responsible for fostering Donquixote Doflamingo's cruelty from a young age, making him the indirect cause of an inhumanly large amount of evil and suffering brought about by Doflamingo's wrath.
Because of this, he can be considered a secondary antagonist in the Dressrosa Arc with a greater influence and impact than what is first suggested in his initial appearances.
