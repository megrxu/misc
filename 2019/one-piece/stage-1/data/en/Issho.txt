Issho, commonly known by his alias Fujitora, is a Marine admiral.
He was conscripted into the Marines through a World Military Draft during the two-year timeskip along with fellow newcomer Ryokugyu, both filling the two vacancies in the admiral positions caused by Kuzan's resignation and Sakazuki's promotion.
Fujitora was first mentioned by Sakazuki when the latter was first discussing plans to deal with Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law.
His following mission and actions on Dressrosa made him the first admiral to make an appearance after the timeskip and the secondary antagonist of the Dressrosa Arc.
Much like his predecessor, Kuzan, Fujitora is strongly against the Marines' dogma of "Absolute Justice" and extremely vocal in his opposition of it.
His disgust with the corruption and evil in the world is such that he intentionally blinded himself many years ago so as to avoid ever seeing it again.
He particularly holds strong disdain for the Shichibukai system, longing to disestablish it, and after learning about the horrific atrocities committed by Donquixote Doflamingo of the Shichibukai in Dressrosa, Fujitora formally apologized to King Riku and his citizens on behalf of the Marines in front of the world, thus infuriating Sakazuki and risking his admiral position.
