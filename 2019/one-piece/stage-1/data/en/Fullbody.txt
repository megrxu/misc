"Double Ironfist" Fullbody is a Marine seaman recruit serving under Captain Hina.
He was a Marine Headquarters lieutenant at the start of the series, but was demoted as a condition when he helped the former Black Cat pirate, Jango, get acquitted for his past crimes (in the anime, it was after getting into a fight with Sanji on the Baratie).
Due to his actions, he is a minor antagonist during the Baratie and Alabasta Arcs.
He also is a supporting character during Jango's Dance Paradise Cover Page Serial.
