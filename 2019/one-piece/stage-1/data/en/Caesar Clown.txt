Caesar Clown, who was referred to as "Master" by his subordinates, is a scientist, a former colleague of Vegapunk, the primary antagonist of the Punk Hazard Arc, and the first main antagonist the Straw Hats face in the New World.
He is the leading expert on chemical weapons of mass destruction and has a bounty of 300,000,000 on his head.
During the Dressrosa Arc, Donquixote Doflamingo declared Caesar to be his direct subordinate, and thus protected from the law.
Upon Doflamingo's defeat and arrest, this protection was lost, and Caesar's criminal status was once again operational in full.
After a period as a hostage of the Straw Hat-Heart Pirate Alliance, he fell into the custody of Big Mom after Capone Bege retrieved and escorted both him and Sanji to Whole Cake Island.
He was later liberated by the Fire Tank Pirates and took part in the assassination attempt against Big Mom.
Following the plan's failure and disbandment of the alliance, he was finally given back his heart and parted ways with his former captors.
