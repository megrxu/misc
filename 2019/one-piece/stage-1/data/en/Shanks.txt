"Red-Haired" Shanks, also commonly known as "Red Hair", is the leader of the Red Hair Pirates and a member of the Yonko that rule over the New World.
He is also a former member of the legendary Roger Pirates, the only group to successfully conquer the Grand Line, where he started as a pirate as an apprentice.
Notably, he is the pirate who inspired Luffy to go on his journey as a pirate, and his crewmate Lucky Roo found the Gomu Gomu no Mi that was accidentally eaten by Luffy.
