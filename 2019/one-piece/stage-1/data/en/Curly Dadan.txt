Curly Dadan is a friend of Monkey D. Garp and the foster mother of Portgas D. Ace and Monkey D. Luffy.
Garp entrusted her to take care of Ace shortly after the boy's birth.
Later, Garp also left Luffy in Dadan's care.
She took care of Sabo too when he moved in.
Dadan lives on Mt.
Colubo near Foosha Village.
She is the Mt.
Colubo mountain bandit boss of the Dadan Family and a wanted criminal.
Dadan was first mentioned in the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, when Woop Slap read about Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates waging war on the World Government.
