Roronoa Zoro, also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro, is a swordsman and combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates and a former bounty hunter.
He was the first member to join the crew, and is considered one of the most dangerous members in it after Luffy.
His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew before he obtained his first bounty.
His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world.
Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the "Worst Generation".
He currently has a bounty of 320,000,000, which is the 4th highest in the crew, after Luffy, Jinbe, and Sanji.
