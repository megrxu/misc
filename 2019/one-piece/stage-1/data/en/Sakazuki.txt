Sakazuki, formerly known by his admiral alias Akainu, is the current fleet admiral of the Marines, succeeding the previous fleet admiral, Sengoku.
During the first half of the series, he was one of the three admirals, and the last one to be fully revealed.
He ascended to the position of fleet admiral after defeating Kuzan in a ten-day duel that left Punk Hazard in its current state.
One of his first decisions was to relocate the Marine Headquarters into the New World in preparation for the New Pirate Age.
In the manga, he was first mentioned by Nico Robin during the initial encounter with Aokiji.
In the anime, he was mentioned earlier by Vice Admiral Jonathan during the anime-only G-8 Arc, which aired after Akainu had been revealed in the manga.
Because of his actions, Akainu was one of the main antagonists of the Marineford Arc and after his promotion, he became one of the central antagonists of the series.
Sakazuki is perhaps the most strident follower of Absolute Justice in the entire series, to the point where his extremism prompted an equally high-ranking colleague to resign from the Marines.
He believes that a person's heritage is a reflection of how big of a threat they pose - a belief which caused him to target Portgas D. Ace and Monkey D. Luffy during the Battle of Marineford for the purpose of purging their "bad blood", which ultimately led him to personally kill Ace and attempt to kill Luffy, which he failed to do - managing only to leave a massive scar on his chest.
