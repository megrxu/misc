Michael and Hoichael are two kids who are troublemakers in the backstreets of Water 7.
They idolize Franky, and even dress like him and use his motto as their own: "Mm, super!!"
They also idolize Paulie.
However, their backstreet delinquency has earned them ire from at least Tilestone and Peepley Lulu.
