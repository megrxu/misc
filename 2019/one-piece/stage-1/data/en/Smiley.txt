Smiley, more commonly known as Slime (スライム, Suraimu), was a pet of Caesar Clown.
It was created by gathering and compressing the poisonous H2S gas that spread throughout Punk Hazard and using Vegapunk's process of Zoan devil fruit animation to bring it to life.
It was kept in the Punk Hazard Burning Lands before being released.
