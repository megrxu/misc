The Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops are a family of seven Super Spot-Billed Ducks (and later one camel) who serve the kingdom of Alabasta.
They are led by their captain Karoo, and are reputed to be the fastest troop in the kingdom of Alabasta.
All of the ducks have the strange theme of wearing different types of hats and various other jewelry and clothing.
Also strange was that the last member to join the squad, Matsuge, is a camel who helped the Straw Hats confront Baroque Works.
