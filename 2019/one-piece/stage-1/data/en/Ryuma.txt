This character's name is sometimes romanized as Ryouma.
Ryuma, also known as Shimotsuki Ryuma (霜月リューマ, Shimotsuki Ryūma), was a legendary samurai from Wano Country who was turned into a General Zombie by Gecko Moria hundreds of years after his death.
He is the same Ryuma from Oda's previous one-shot manga, Monsters.
His corpse previously possessed Brook's shadow to animate him while on Thriller Bark.
