Captain John was a famous pirate captain who was once a member of the infamous Rocks Pirates prior to forming his own crew.
He was notable for collecting one of the most significant treasures in the world; his fabled treasure cave and the riches within are notably long sought after by Buggy.
After his death, his corpse was found by Dr. Hogback and modified into one of the General Zombies of Gecko Moria.
