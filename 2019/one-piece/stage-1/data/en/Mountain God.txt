The Mountain God, respectfully called Yama-san (山さん, Yama-san, VIZ Media: Yama) by Kozuki Oden and his retainers, is a giant boar that lived in the forests of Wano Country as late as thirty years ago.
In what became known as the Mountain God Incident, it was cut down by Kozuki Oden during its attack on Flower Capital, but it ultimately survived the ordeal.
