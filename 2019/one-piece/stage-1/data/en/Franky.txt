"Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates.
A cyborg from Water 7, he was originally the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers.
He is originally from South Blue , but left 32 years ago as a four-year-old child.
He was originally named "Cutty Flam" until he threw away his original name for his nickname per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity.
Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc.
At the request of the Franky Family, Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny.
He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join Luffy's crew.
He currently has a bounty of 94,000,000.
Previously going by the epithet, "Cyborg" Franky, he has since gained the new nickname, "Iron Man".
