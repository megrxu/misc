Because of his great benevolence, he was seen as peculiar for a Celestial Dragon, and his compatriots even condemn him for being blasphemous for equaling himself with the rest of humanity. However, after experiencing discrimination by angry victims of the World Nobles, he realized that he was na√Øve as he had no prior knowledge of the hatred and resentment commoners had towards World Nobles. Despite his pampered past, he was at least appreciative of even the most minor opportunities for his family's safety, as when they found a relatively safe hideout in the junkyard, he felt relieved despite the insect infestations that Doflamingo alone complained about."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "He was extremely protective of his family and loved them very much.

He wanted them to realize their own humanities and live a humble family life together, away from the arrogant abuse of the World Nobles' privileges. His love for his family was proven genuine, as he was worried about their well-being over his own and would even plead for mercy on their behalf, as opposed to how Saint Rosward was more concerned for his clan's ancestral pride when his son was assaulted by Monkey D. Luffy. Believing that it was his own fault that his sons were condemned to a hellish childhood of extreme hardship and agony, Homing did nothing to retaliate when Doflamingo prepared to kill him, willing to accept death to atone for all the suffering he had brought upon his sons, his last words being a tearful apology to them."}], "images": []}, {"title": "Wife", "level": 4, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "text": "Homing's wife loved him enough that she followed him into a life among commoners.

Prior to their family's tragic turn, Doflamingo respected his father as a fellow Celestial Dragon and spoke to him with civility (though in a manner of a spoiled son). However, Homing's choice was a negative turning point for their father-son relationship, as his choice dragged his entire family into a life of persecution and suffering, which Doflamingo blames and curses his father for to this day. This anger and resentment toward his father would ultimately lead to Doflamingo taking Homing's life. Despite Homing's final apology for ruining his children's lives, it did not stir Doflamingo's sympathies in the least. Doflamingo's loss of respect for his father would lead him to badmouthing the man in front of others, ridiculing Homing and his humble ideals, and even relishing in the memory of his patricide.

Indeed, when Doflamingo was preparing to shoot Homing, Rosinante cried in his father's arms while pleading for his brother not to kill him, to no avail.

Unfortunately for him, the Celestial Dragons no longer cared about a traitor who had declared himself a mere human, and callously refused his request, warning him to never call them again.

With both sides of society rejecting him and his family, Homing despaired for the last two years of his life, struggling to survive in fear from the society he once wished to live in harmony with, watching his wife driven to death while he and his sons were violently tortured, and hearing his desperate pleas for mercy utterly ignored."}], "images": []}, {"title": "Abilities and Powers", "level": 2, "content": [{"type": "paragraph", "text": "As a World Noble, he could do as he pleased, without facing any legal consequences.

Coupled with his pampered past and lack of knowledge of prejudice that commoners have towards his heritage and the loss of the World Government's protection, Homing had a difficult time surviving in the North Blue, barely able to gather food to keep himself and sons alive, and watching helplessly as his wife died.

Concealing themselves in a derelict shack, Homing called the World Nobles and begged them to rescue at least his wife and sons, stating that they do not deserve to suffer the consequences for his personal choice. Unfortunately, the World Nobles coldly rejected him, warning him to never call them again; Doflamingo overheard this with silent shock. His wife eventually died from illness brought about by their unsanitary household and lack of food. Shortly after this, the mob found the rotting shack the family was hiding in and tortured Homing and his two sons.
