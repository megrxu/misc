It was Usopp who targeted him from a roof nearby and tried to act bravely. This caused Arlong to go berserk, and in retaliation, he destroyed the house that Usopp was perched on. Afraid that their leader would destroy the entire village for which they need to receive money, the fish-men restrained him and promised to catch Usopp and drag him back to Arlong Park."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Arlong returned to Arlong Park and found that Zoro had struck down all of his men. His mood quickly shifted when his men announced that Usopp had been captured. In order to regain the trust of the pirates who started to think that she let the swordman escape, Nami started to fight with Usopp. She even stabbed him and plunged him into the sea. Satisfied by this behavior worth of a true Arlong Pirate, the fish-men congratulated her. However, she told Arlong that she only did that so that she could buy her village back."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Meanwhile, a Marine ship led by Commodore Pudding Pudding arrived to try to liberate the inhabitants of the island. The ship fired a cannon ball against the Arlong Park. Arlong easily broke it with his teeth. The pirates got rid of them easily with only three of Arlong's officers. With the strength of the fish-men and Nami's skill with maps, they believed they would conquer the East Blue. Later, Arlong had some Marines led by a Nezumi take away all the money Nami collected over the years. After her money was taken away, Nami ran back to Arlong and accused him of sending the Marines to look for her money. However, Arlong denied it, claiming that he never broke their deal and told her that if she wanted her village back, she would just need to start again from scratch. Nami ran off both in fury and anguish as he laughed."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Yosaku and Johnny then attempted to fight the Arlong Pirates but were easily defeated.

Hatchan then summoned Momoo to deal with Luffy and his comrades. However, when the giant sea cow appeared, he expressed fear after his previous encounter with Sanji and Luffy. Arlong then blackmailed Momoo, prompting him to attack the Straw Hats. Luffy, thanks to a new attack, used Momoo to blow Arlong's grunts away. The officers of the Arlong Pirates did not seem to be worried at all. Chew requested Arlong to calm down and they would fight the Straw Hats. Hatchan attacked the Straw Hats with his Jet Ink. However, all of the Straw Hats (with an exception of Luffy, who's feet was stuck in the ground from the last attack) were able to dodge the attack, leaving Luffy doused from head to toe with ink. Arlong took advantage of Luffy's weakness of the sea and uprooted a portion of the concrete surrounding Luffy's implanted feet and tossed him into the nearby pool."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "After Arlong's officers had been defeated, Sanji and Zoro fought Arlong in order to gain some time for Luffyâs rescue, but they were no match for his strength as they were easily defeated.

He gave her a choice: to be his eternal navigator and spare the villagers, but have Sanji and Zoro die for causing too much trouble, or have all the villagers killed. While Zoro kept Arlong distracted, and with minor interference from Hatchan, Sanji dove back into the water and freed Luffy's body. Back on land, Arlong ripped off the bandages on Zoroâs chest, injuring him even more and shocking everybody.

They were ineffective against Arlong, but Luffy stated that it was just the warm-up. Arlong told Luffy about the innate superiority of fish-men on the humans and provided a direct demonstration. Luffy was only barely able to avoid the fatal attacks of a shark. When Luffy showed him that he has a different type of strength, Arlong mocked him since Luffy was unable to get out of the water without help. Luffy then told him that needing help is not a sign of weakness, and without his friends, he would be helpless, but he would be the one who could defeat Arlong. Arlong attempted to bite off Luffy's head, but he took out a chunk of the pillar behind him. Luffy continued to mock him and he took up two swords to fight with, but Arlong effortlessly took them away.

Luffy broke his teeth out again and stole one of his castanet teeth to use against him. Arlong hit Luffy in his side with the remaining weapon as Luffy retaliated by stuffing his own teeth in his mouth to use as a weapon and bite down on his neck."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Arlong stated that the power of the bite did not come from the teeth but from the jaw muscles as he bit through Luffy's arm. Luffy freed himself by slamming him to the ground, releasing his hold on his arm. Arlong then took to the water to fight, gaining the advantage of speed. Launching himself like a torpedo, his attack's increasing speed was able to break through all solid objects. Luffy was able to catch him and critically injured him with a powerful kick to his stomach. Arlong snapped and his eyes changed, resembling that of a Sea King before it attacks.

Luffy noticed and commented that the room was filled with papers. Arlong told him they were not just any papers and the room was where Nami was used to draw maps. Arlong further acknowledged Nami's talents and told Luffy that Nami was his friend. Luffy then responded by telling Arlong that Nami is the Straw Hats' navigator. In turn, Arlong told Luffy that Nami's talent would be wasted by being with them. Arlong kept declaring that Nami would continue to draw maps for his world domination and he would use her better than Luffy could ever do so himself. Luffy, enraged from hearing Arlong's words, crushed one of the teeth from the Kiribachi, causing Arlong to hesitate."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Arlong continued by telling Luffy that Nami got all she needed by being with the Arlong Pirates and she would forever remain his tool or rather his \"friend\". Luffy, upon hearing this statement, began to destroy the room. Arlong got angry, saying that Luffy was destroying his ambitions along with the room. Luffy and Arlong continued to battle and Luffy told Arlong that the only thing he understood was that he needed to help Nami. With that being said, Luffy commented that he could not let that room exist and he would destroy it all. Using the full power of his attack Gomu Gomu no Ono, Luffy managed to send the full force of Arlong's attack, Shark On Teeth, through to the bottom of Arlong Park, destroying the building in the process and defeating the fish-man.
