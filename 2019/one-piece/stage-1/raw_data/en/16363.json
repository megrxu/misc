For example, Franky modified his right arm to function somewhat like a bludgeoning tool while modifying the left to house several gunner-type weapons. He could not possibly interchange both functions in both arms with each other whenever he feels like it. Also, because he personally made the modifications on himself, there were several restrictions when he converted his body into a cyborg, namely the place around his back area where he wasn't able to reach around with his arms, leaving it lacking with metallic reinforcement in comparison to the rest of his body."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "It is later revealed that, given that they were originally flesh and blood, vestiges of their former states still remain within a cyborg's body.

This is shown when the Straw Hats encounter the Pacifistas after the timeskip, since these prototypes were (according to Sentomaru) only as strong as they were two years ago, they did not stand a chance against the \"Monster Trio\", who were able to grow incredibly strong."}, {"type": "paragraph", "text": "One other weakness that the cyborgs whose personality is erased (like the Pacifistas) seem to share, is that they, like zombies, seem unable to feel pain, and thus are unable to realize when they are in danger, though with their sensors and programming may counteract this to an extent (depending on what their programming is)."}], "images": []}, {"title": "Trivia", "level": 2, "content": [{"type": "list", "elements": [{"text": "Initially, the first cyborg Oda wished to release was Don Krieg, as Don Krieg-9000, but the idea was scrapped.
